        Connect-Four is a  tic-tac-toe-like two-player game 
         <ul>
           <li>Players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high.  </li>
           <li>Each player uses pieces of a particular color.  </li> 
           <li>The object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. </li>
          <li> The board is vertical and pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column.</li> 
         <li>As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.</li>
         <li>Both players begin with 21 identical pieces. </li>
         <li>The first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game.  </li>
         <li> If all 42 men are played and no player has places four pieces in a row, the game is drawn.</li>
         </ul>
