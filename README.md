## Description

#### Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. The board is vertical and pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.

#### Both players begin with 21 identical pieces, and the first player to achieve a line of four connected pieces wins the game. If all 42 men are played and no player has places four pieces in a row, the game is drawn.
